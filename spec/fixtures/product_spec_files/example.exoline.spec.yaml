# Example client specification file
# Specification files are in YAML format (a superset of JSON
# with more readable syntax and support for comments) and
# look like this. They may contain comments that begin
# with a # sign.

# Device client model information
device:
    model: "myModel"
    vendor: "myVendor"

# list of dataports that must exist
dataports:
      # this the absolute minimum needed to specify a
      # dataport.
    - alias: mystring
      # names are created, but not compared
    - name: Temperature
      # aliases, type, and format are created
      # and compared

      format: string/json
      # JSON schema specified inline (http://json-schema.org/)

      public: true

    # any dataports not listed but found in the client
    # are ignored. The spec command does not delete things.

# list of script datarules that must exist
scripts:
    # by default, scripts are datarules with
    # names and aliases set to the file name
    - file: test/files/helloworld.lua
    # you can also set them explicitly
    - file: test/files/helloworld.lua
      alias: greeting
    # you can also place lua code inline
    - alias: singleLineScript
      code: debug('hello from inside lua!')

    # be indented inside the "code:" key.
    - alias: multilineScript
      code: |

            debug('hello from for loop ' .. x)
        end
    # simple templating for script aliases and
    # content is also supported.
    - file: test/files/convert.lua
      # if <% id %> is embedded in aliases
      # or script content, the --ids parameter must
      # be passed in. The spec command then expects
      # a script or dataport resource per id passed, substituting
      # each ID for <% id %>. In this example, if the command was:
      #
      # $ exo spec mysensor sensorspec.yaml --ids=A,B
      #
      # ...then the spec command looks for *two* script datarules
      # in mysensor, with aliases convertA.lua and convertB.lua.
      # Additionally, any instances of <% id %> in the content of
      # convert.lua are substituted with A and B before being
      # written to each script datarule.
      #
      alias: convert<% id %>.lua
